        <p class="cursive">I was born and raised in Minneapolis,
            Minnesota and I moved to Texas six years ago. I am an identical twin
            and my sister and I are very close. In my free time I enjoy dancing,
            singing and spending time with my family and friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since graduating with my bachelor's degree in Communication Studies in 2010,
            I have been on a journey to figure out what career path to follow.
            Over the last 8 years, I held many positions in various fields. I worked
            in different call centers doing customer service, technical support and collections.
            For two years I was self-employed as a Healthcare IT consultant and I traveled across
            the country training doctors on electronic medical records. I spent another two years
            working at Southwest Airlines in the internal technical support help desk.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, none of those positions were fulfilling to me. No matter how good the
            pay or benefits were, I could not see my self staying long term. I started to ask
            myself what I would do if pay and benefits weren't a factor. It took a lot of trial
            and error to discover what I actually had a passion for but in early 2018 I finally
            had my 'ah ha' moment. At that time, I was spending a lot of time online trying to
            figure out how to build my own website. Before I knew it, I was researching coding
            online and I was spending several hours at a time, day after day doing it. Now I am
            attending a coding bootcamp and I couldn't be more excited that I am finally going to
            have the career I have been searching for.
